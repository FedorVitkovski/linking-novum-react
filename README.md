## Linking Novum React (Web App)
## This app provides a way for linking sections of different books to each other with the goal to create a hyper text.

### TODOs
1. ~~Mark the currently selected verse somehow.~~
2. ~~Submit on enter.~~
3. ~~Set a global host for AJAX requests.~~
4. Find a way to remove the className from the verse (currently needed for higlighting blocks).
    1. When done, don't forget to remove !important from the background-color of the Verse.
5. Currently the BookView is touching the LinkView, add some margin/padding.
6. When the user selects a verse a button to create a link should pop up.
7. Change the book input to select, where the books are fully written out names.
8. Refactor to accomodate for expanded LinkView (contained within a modal).
9.
